# libft
Coding prototypes of functions in c. Build into a single library using makefile

This is the first project of the Ecole42 (School21 in Russia)
What the point?
How i think after it done. Learn and understand on practice about:
  - data types: char, int, size_t, bool, void;
  - ascii;
  - pointers;
  - arrays;
  - working with memory;
  - include file;
  - macroprocessor;
  - working with strings: count, search, convert, compare, join;
  - learn how convert from char to int and back;
  - print output different data types using only printf;
  - makefile
  - codestyle.
Bonus part is linked lists. I stored it in another repository.
This project gives an understanding of how functions work under the hood.
